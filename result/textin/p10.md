## Abstract

Temperature is a key variable in biological processes. However, a complete understanding of biological temperature adaptation is lacking, in part because of the unique constraints among different evolutionary lineages and physiological groups. Here we compared the genomes of cultivated psychrotolerant and thermotolerant methanogens, which are physiologically related and span growth temperatures from -2.5∘C to 122∘C. Despite being phylogenetically distributed amongst three phyla in the archaea, the genomic core of cultivated methanogens comprises about one-third of a given genome, while the genome fraction shared by any two organisms decreases with increasing phylogenetic distance between them. Increased methanogenic growth temperature is associated with reduced genome size, and thermotolerant organisms-which are distributed across the archaeal tree-have larger core genome fractions, suggesting that genome size is governed by temperature rather than phylogeny. Thermotolerant methanogens are enriched in metal and other transporters, and psychrotolerant methanogens are enriched in proteins related to structure and motility. Observed amino acid compositional differences between temperature groups include proteome charge, polarity and unfolding entropy. Our results suggest that in the methanogens, shared physiology maintains a large, conserved genomic core even across large phylogenetic distances and biology's temperature extremes.

## Introduction

Life is a chemical process: it follows that temperature is a key determinant both of rate and reaction favourability.1,2Temperature effects can be seen across biology,3 and it is of interest to consider these from an evolutionary perspective. Althoughrecent phylogenetic trees do not necessarily indi-cate a basal placement of thermophiles, the history of life in relation to temperature has been debated ever since the first trees placed thermophilic lineages in basal positions4-7suggesting that taxonomic evolution may be entangled with temperature.

An ongoing challenge has been to identify how organisms adapt to life at high temperatures16-21 Able to grow from -2.5to 122∘C,8,9 methanogens span perhaps the largest tempera-ture range of any single physiological group. Methanogens generally produce methane from (CO2and H2,acetate and/or methylated compounds,10,11 and are found in environments including animal rumens,12 to wetlands,13 to hydrothermal vents,14 to subglacial sediments.15

To avoid confounding factors when considering different lifestyles and phylogenetic backgrounds, Lecocq et al.22 in-vestigated the Methanococcales,finding that amino acid sub-stitution patterns, rather than the acquisition of orthogroups best explain thermotolerance. Other previous comparative genomic studies of methanogens focused on pairs of species or organisms within a specific clade.23-25

We sought to investigate possible genome adaptations to temperature by comparatively analysing genomes of cul-tured organisms for which growth temperature and substrate utilization information is available. By analysing methano-gens as a physiologically similar yet phylogenetically diverse group,we specifically aimed to constrain metabolic variables and to search for temperature effects on genome evolution which might existas general adaptation strategies rather than as synapomorphies unique to specific phylogenetic groups. Our study compliments and adds to our understandings of what makes a methanogen a methanogen, and how they have genomically evolved over time.

## Methodology

### Establishing a methanogen database

As a first step, the diversity of alkane-activating archaea was investigated based on the presence of alpha, beta and gamma subunits of the methyl-coenzyme M reductase (Mcr) enzyme using Annotree v1.2.0.26 The KEGG UniRef100database27 was used to query the alpha (K00399),beta (K00401) and gamma (K00402) subunits in archaea with default parameters (min. 30% identity, max. E value 0.00001, min. 70% subject and query alignment). This search re-sulted in a total of 290 genome hits across six archaeal phyla including Halobacteriota (156), Methanobacteriota (94), Thermoplasmatota (27), Thermoproteota (10), Asgardarchaeota (2) and Hadarchaeota (1). Their protein sequences were downloaded from the GTDB data reposi-tory (GTDB release 95.28 A total of 255 genomes were con-sidered for further analyses after a quality cut-off (checkM score≥90). In previous taxonomic descriptions, methanogens were separated into Class one (Methanobacteriota) and Class two (Halobacteriota) methanogens within the Euryarchaeota phylum,29however here we describe their taxonomy using that of GTDB release 95.

Temperature data for cultured organisms were accessed through the Database of Growth TEMPeratures of Usual and Rare Prokaryotes (TEMPURA, Sato et al.30) and substrate data was added from the PhyMet2 database.31 This data com-pilation is available in Supplementary Table S1.Phylogenetic trees with annotations were visualized using the interactive tree of life online tool.32

A total of 86 organisms had temperature data available and were used for the main analyses herein. There is no universal definition for growth temperatures to classify organisms into psychrotolerant and thermotolerant groups. Here we defined these temperature groups based on the overall distribution of growth temperatures for methanogenesis (Supplementary Fig. S1). Organisms were classified into psychrotolerant organ-isms with a minimum growth temperature≤15∘Cand with no growth observed above 45∘C. Thermotolerant organisms have a maximum growth temperature≥45∘Cand no growth observed below 15∘C. Organisms spanning ≤15∘C to ≥45∘C are considered as mesophilic. This classification resulted in 21 psychrotolerant, 41 thermotolerant and 24 mesophilic species.

### Core and pangenomes

Core-and pangenomes were established with OrthoFinder33running with default parameters on both the 255 species with checkM score≥90and the 86 species with available tempera-ture data. The resulting orthogroups were separated into the core(here we used the extended core of orthogroups present in more than 95% of organisms to account for incomplete genomes), shared (orthogroups present in at least two but less than 95% of organisms) and unique (genes present only in one organism) groups. These groupings were used for all sub-sequent analyses.

For comparison to other microbes, genera with tempera-ture data for at least five of their member species were selected from the TEMPURA database and five species selected ran-domly for core genome analyses using Proteinortho,34 run with the default parameters. The number of species was kept constant to account for the reduction of the core size with the addition of species35 and to keep the analyses comparable. Fourteen archaeal and bacterial genera, including two meth-anogenic ones,are represented by at least five species and were used for this analysis, with eight thermotolerant (Pyrococcus, Pyrobaculum, Thermococcus, Methanocaldococcus, Acidianus, Thermotoga, Caldicellulosiruptor,and Fervidobacterium), four mesophilic (Acholeplasma, Bacteroides,Eubacterium and Methanosarcina) and two psychrotolerant (Cryobacterium and Paraglaciecola) genera.

### Composition and function

Functional annotations of all genes in each orthogroup were made with eggnogmapper version 5.36 Initial overviews of functional differences between orthogroup and temperature groups were done based on cluster of orthologous genes (COG) categories. Subsequently KEGG orthology output from eggnogmapper was used to map reactions unique to temperature groups as well as substrate groups with the KEGG pathway module.27

Amino acid biases were assessed by counting amino acids coded by open reading frames in the whole genomes as well as core and shared fractions. Based on amino acid compositions, proteome properties were calculated based on Gromiha et al.37 indicating the average property of a residue within a species' proteome. To test for statistically significant trends with temperature in amino acid composition and amino acid residue properties, Pearson correlation P-values were calcu-lated for amino acid counts as well as residue properties for each species using the statistical functions module in python's scipy package38 and tested for statistical significance with the Benjamini Hochberg correction using the fdrcorrection func-tonwithmethod='indep' in the mne module in python.39

### Ancestral reconstruction for orthogroups

Count40 was used for estimations of gene gain and loss events using Wagner parsimony as well as to establish rate model optimization using the gain-loss-duplication model41 with the Poisson family size distribution at the root.Lineage-specific variations were left unspecified, and all other parameters were kept at default. The input data for this analysis was the group of 86 methanogens associated with growth temperature data.

## Results and discussion

### Phylogenetic distribution of growth temperature and physiology among methanogens

Using Annotree, we found 290 archaeal genomes contain the Mcr alpha, beta and gamma subunits, out of which 255 are considered to have a high enough quality for analyses (checkM score≥90).Those genomes range in size from 1.112 Mbp (WYZ-LMO11 sp004348015 of the Methanometbyliaceae family) to 5.752 Mbp (Methanosarcina acetivorans) and span five phyla, 17 classes, 21 orders, 38 families and 99 genera, which highlights the continued taxonomic expansion of Mcr containing archaea.11,42,43 A list of these genomes with in-formation on their size, quality and where available growth temperature ranges, isolation environments and growth sub-strates of species is available in Supplementary Table S1.

Among the 255 high-quality archaeal genomes, substrate data from cultivation studies is available for 11231 (Fig.1). The Methanomicrobia, Methanococci, Methanocellia and Methanobacteria genera are strictly hydrogenotrophic, Methanotrichales strictly aceticlastic and all genera in the Methanosarcinaceae family besides Methanosarcina are strictly methylotrophic, while some species within Methanosarcina are capable of methanogenesis from (CO2and H22, acetate and/or methylated compounds. Eighty-three species hhave capabilities for hydrogenotrophic meth-anogenesis, while 72 are strict hydrogenotrophs unable to use other methanogenesis pathways. Psychrotolerant hydrogenotrophic organisms include members of the class

Methanomicrobia, whereas thermotolerant ones include Methanopyri, Methanobacteria andMethanococci.With the exception of Methermicoccus shengliensis (methylotroph) and Methanothrix B thermoacetopbila (aceticlastic), all meth-anogens with maximum growth temperatures≥65∘Care hydrogenotrophic. Thirty species are methylotrophic with a majority of these being psychrotolerant (Methanosarcinales) and 20 being strict methylotrophs. Finally, 17 are aceticlastic, mostly psychrotolerant species (Methanotrichales), with seven strict aceticlastic organisms. Other growth substrates for methanogenesis include butanol, 2-butanol,isobutanol, propanol, 2-propanol, carbon monoxide, cyclopentanol,di-methyl sulfide, ethanol, and formate, though these were omitted from our analysis since these substrates have been less frequently tested for growth compared with hydrogen, acetate and methyl-compounds.31

Thermotolerant organisms are associated with the shortest branches to the root of the archaeal species tree (Fig. 2;this figure is also redrawn using minimum and maximum growth temperatures in Supplementary Fig. S2). This follows the ini-tial observation of Woese,44 who found that hyperthermophilic archaea were basal in the tree of life. In the case of the meth-anogens, the combined observation of short branch lengths and small genomes (see below, Fig. 4A) may run counter to a thermo-reduction hypothesis of genome evolution.45

### The methanogen pan-and core genomes

Eighty-six isolated methanogens have growth temperature data available in the TEMPURA database30 (a species tree is shown in Supplementary Fig. S4). These span 3 phyla, 8 classes, 10 orders, 19 families and 45 genera. A total of 211,659 genes fromthese 86 organisms were grouped into 10,131 orthogroups, out of which 791 orthogroups con-taining 2,329 genes are unique to a single genome. The core includes 330 orthogroups, which are shared by all 86 species, while 552 orthogroups belong to the extended core, which is shared by more than 95% of species. We adopt this relaxed measure proposed by Charlebois and Doolittle35 to account for partially incomplete genomes.

The extended core of these 86 methanogens consists largely of genes related to biosynthesis (57%), coenzyme transport and metabolism (13%). Eleven percent of genes have un-known functions and the remaining 19% are functionally related to lipid biosynthesis, ion transport, secondary metab-olites,intracellular transports, motility, cell wall and mem-brane biogenesis, cell cycle control or carbohydratetransport (Supplementary Fig. S5). The remaining 8,788 orthogroups found in these species belong to the shared fraction of the pan-genome; those genes shared by at least two but less than 95% of organisms in the analysis. Distributions of the number of orthogroup sizes are shown in Fig. 3A. Extended

**Figure** 3. Core-and pangenome analysis of cultivated methanogens. (A) Distribution of the number of orthogroups across the methanogens. (B) Core-and pangenomes of the methanogens, where each bar is one species. Colours in both A and B indicate extended core (shared by at least 95% of the organisms), shared and unique genome fractions.

core-and pan-genome sizes for each genome are shown in Fig.3B.

The mean size of the extended genomic core is 33.74% (30% in psychrotolerant and 35% in thermotolerant or-ganisms). This fraction is large, considering that these or-ganisms span three different phyla and comparable core sizes can be found at the genus level (e.g. Comamonas46 or Streptococcus47). Interestingly, a large core fraction between phylogenetically diverse thermoacidophilic archaea was also observed.48 In that case, the constraints of life at low pH were thought to contribute to the large shared genome core. For the methanogens however, the environmental conditions are not constrained: in addition to temperature, growth pH of the organisms studied here ranges from 4.3 to 10,31 suggesting that the methanogen core genome may be constrained by the biochemical requirements of methanogenesis.

The addition of more genomes into core comparison ana-lyses will reduce the core size.35 We find that when including all genomes that contain McrABG and have a checkM score of ≥90, the extended core contains 403 orthogroups,which is a 27% reduction in comparison to the core size observed when including only the 86 cultivated members. This set in-cludes 255 genomes from methanogens, methanotrophs and other alkane-activating archaea: it appears to be the common core for alkane metabolizing archaea (all orthogroups for this analysis in Supplementary Table S2).

### Temperature and methanogen genome content

Thermal adaptation in the methanogens does not appear to be accomplished by the use of specific orthologous gene sets: There is neither a thermotolerant nor psychrotolerant specific core (i.e. orthogroups found in all organisms of one tempera-ture group but not in the other). This being said, there are genes found exclusively in one temperature but not the other. Thermotolerant organisms are found with (metal) transporter genes and transcriptional regulators and contain the DNA re-pair gene rad51 and reverse gyrase, while psychrotolerant or-ganisms have genes related to membrane and salt transport, membrane fusion, signaling and motility, chaperones and the DNA repair gene recN (comprehensive list in Table 1). Since these genes are not conserved in the temperature groups, they might be related to environmental factors other than temperature, such as high metal concentrations at hydro-thermal vent systems, or high salinity in cold environments requiring additional membrane proteins and salt transporters in psychrotolerant organisms.

It may be that reverse gyrase is the only conserved and specific hyperthermophile protein,49,50 while chaperones and genes involved in membrane and cell wall biogenesis have been implicated in psychrotolerant species.⁵1 Our analysis suggests that thermal adaptation in the methanogens may be largely accomplished by mechanisms other than the use of specific genes-perhaps as detailed below by amino acid sub-stitution patterns.

In a previous analysis with hyperthermophilic bacteria and archaea,52 107 COGs specific to hyperthermophilic ar-chaea were identified out of which 58 are shared across the domains. From these 58 COGs, those with known functions belong to predicted DNA repair systems, metabolic functions (n=9),replication and repair genes(=4),and one each to translation-related genes and the COG category transcription-related genes and cellular processes. In our analysis, the ma-jority of temperature group specific orthogroups have no functional assignment, and these may be experimental targets for understanding the molecular basis of thermotolerance.

### Temperature and methanogen genome size

The genomes of thermotolerant species are on average ~30% smaller than those of organismsgrowing at colder temper-atures (Fig. 4A; also see Supplementary Fig. S3 for a com-parison of genome size with minimum and maximum growth temperature), a trend that is not unique to methanogens and has been observed throughout the bacteria and archaea;30

Five genomes from each genus were randomly chosen so as to have equal genomic representation between the different groups. (D) Core sizes withToptfor each species across the aforementioned genera. Colours in (A)-(D) indicate temperature groups used in this study (blue-psychrotolerant, red-thermotolerant, black-no group/mesophilic. Shapes in (A) and (B) indicate class level phylogenies (circle-Methanobacteria,upward triangle-Methanocellia,square-Methanococci,x-Methanomicrobia, left point triangle-Methanonatronarchaeia, right point triangle-Methanopyri, diamond-Methanosarcinia, star-Thermoplasmata).

Fig. 4C). Among all methanogens, genome size ranges from 1.24 Mbp (Methanothermus fervidus) to 5.75 Mbp (Methanosarcina acetivorans). For psychrotolerant species the mean genome size is 2.85 Mbp with 2748 ORFs (min.1.61Mbp in Methanobrevibacter D filiformis, max. 4.14 Mbp in Methanosarcina lacustris), while for their thermotolerant counterparts the mean genome size is 2.12 Mbp with 2096ORFs (min. 1.24 Mbp in Methanothermus fervidus,max. 4.14 Mbp in Methanosarcina mazei).

To investigate if core size is correlated with growth tem-perature, the 86 methanogens and 5 species each from a total of 14 bacterial and archaeal genera were plotted. As temperature increases, genome size decreases while the core fraction increases both for the methanogens and ar-chaea and bacteria (Fig. 4B and D). The two methanogenic genera included in these analyses (Methanocaldococcus and Methanosarcina, both containing more than five species) group with other genera of similar growth temperature ranges (Fig.4D).

## Substrate-specific orthogroups

Between the substrate groups of aceticlastic, methylotrophic and hydrogenotrophic methanogens, the methylotrophs contain specific methyltransferases as has previously been reported,53-55 while hydrogenotrophs contain hydrogen-ases and dehydrogenases as described by Costa and Leigh.56Interestingly, we find that aceticlastic methanogens have no unique genes related to methane metabolism (comprehen-sive list in Supplementary Table S3). This could indicate a general ability of methanogens to metabolize acetate,which has been observed in the hydrogenotroph Methanococcus maripaludis.57 In addition to considering variations with respect to carbon chemistry, Lyu and Lu58 showed genome

<!-- Temperature effects across methanogen pangenomes 7 -->

content differences in Class I and Class II methanogens (those formerly known as Methanobacteriota and Halobacteriota), with the latter having greater oxidative adaptation abilities.

## Phylogenetic distance negatively correlates with shared orthogroups

Across the phylogenetic diversity of methanogens, we com-pared the pairwise number of orthogroups shared be-tween two genomes at the genus, family and phylum level. Excluding those clades with only one genome member, our comparisons include 180 pairwise comparisons in 23 genera, 884 in 12 families and 3640 in 2 phyla (Fig. 5).We find that within a genus, two species can share as little as 40% of their orthogroups (within the genus Methanosarcina) and a decrease in shared fractions with increasing phylogenetic distance. On average 67.95% of orthogroups are shared be-tween two species within a genus, 54.66% of orthogroups are shared between two species in a family and 43.27% of orthogroups are shared between two species in a phylum. Our observations are related to those presented by Touchon et al.,59 who found that gene repertoire relatedness decreases with increasing phylogenetic distance, but more work is needed to understand how genome content varies at different taxonomic depths.

In a previous analysis including two hydrogenotrophic spe-cies from the Methanothermobacter genus,23 orthogroups shared between the two genomes were largely related to CO2reduction and energy conservation, as well as the transloca-tion of metals and ions other than sodium. Between those two species from the same genus, 85% and 91% of genomic content was shared respectively. In another study, Borton et al.24 showed that across eleven genomes within the genus Methanohalopbilus, most core genes accounted for house-keeping and methylotrophic methanogenesis-related functions. The core accounted for only 42.5-49.4% of the total genome size, which may be attributed to the inclusion of MAGs that tend to have lower completeness and quality scores.

## Amino acid composition of the proteome

It has been suggested that compositional biases in amino acid content are not observable at thhe whole genome level,60 how-ever for the methanogens, we observe compositional shifts when comparing methanogens at both the whole proteome and conserved extended core levels. Out of 20 amino acids, 14 show significant correlations with the optimum growth temperature of organisms, with slightly more pronounced dif-ferences in the shared proteome compared to the extended core (Fig. 6). Polar uncharged amino acids are increased in the psychrotolerant species, while lysine, glutamic acid, leu-cine and isoleucine are increased in thermotolerant species. In psychrotolerant organisms, amino acid substitutions in-crease protein flexibility and specific activity and decrease thermostability,61,62 while in thermotolerant organisms sta-bility is increased.63

Our results are in line with Saunders et al.,64 who com-pared then available methanogen species(=9)and found an almost linear trend in the content of glutamine, threonine and leucine over the range of studied growth temperatures (15-98∘C with glutamine and threonine being more abun-dant and leucine being less abundant in cold-tolerant archaea. Our results are also in agreement with a previous study of the methanogenic genus Methanococcus,which found that amino acid biases are affected mostly by optimal growth temperature and not by phylogenetic distance,65 and most re-cently with the result of Lecocq et al.22 who found that amino acid frequency variation is the main driver in temperature adaptation in the order Methanococcales.

Interestingly, amino acid compositional trends were gener-ally found to be uncorrelated between psychrotolerant and thermotolerant species analysed at the family level.66 Our re-sults suggest that for the methanogens, a shared biochemical repertoire underlies coordinated amino acid changes across the growth temperature range.

The amino acid composition of a proteome has a direct impact on its structural and energetic features:We find that

**Figure** **6**: Amino acid compositional differences between temperature groups. Positive percentages indicate amino acid enrichment in psychrotolerant species, and negative percentages indicate amino acid enrichment in thermotolerant species. Percentages were obtained by averaging the relative amino acid abundance over the proteome/extended core orthogroups/shared orthogroups of the two temperature groups and subtracting the thermotolerant mean from the psychrotolerant mean. Circles denote amino acids that have significant correlation with temperature across the whole range of temperatures and for all 86 species, when optimal growth temperature was plotted against each amino acid's abundance (Benjamini Hochberg correction on Pearson P-values). Amino acid abundances for each OG grouping can be found in Supplementary Table S4.

the proportion of charged amino acids and hydrophobicity have positive correlations with optimum growth tempera-ture, while amino acid properties associated with structural complexity such as turn and coil tendencies,have negative correlations with the optimum growth temperature (Fig. 7;Table 2). Comparing of unfolding entropy and enthalpy (Fig. 7B and C) reinforces our understanding that protein folding is entropically driven. Some of these properties have been described for thermophilic enzymes in Ando et al.,67where the authors propose mechanisms that increase the sta-bility of those enzymes, including entropic stabilization.68Interestingly, although the average isoelectric point of amino acids in the proteome increases with increasing temperature, the charge state of the amino acids across the whole prote-omes of hyperthermophilic methanogens may be closer to zero compared to their mesophilic relatives since the average amino acid isoelectric point is closer to neutral water at higher temperatures (Supplementary Fig. S6; recall that neutral pH changes from 7 at 25℃ to 6.1 at 100°C'). It is also possible that the increase in lysine observed in thermotolerant organ-isms drives the increase in proteome isoelectric point (Fig. 7).

An important and interesting outlier in our study is Methanopyrus kandleri, which grows at the highest tempera-ture of the methanogens at 122°C. Surprisingly, this organism exhibits many proteome properties, such as bulkiness,flexi-bility, helical contact area, solvent accessible surface area and volume, more similar to mesophilic than other thermotolerant organisms (Supplementary Fig. S6; Methanopyrus kandleri is found near the 100°C mark of its optimal temperature). This observation raises questions about the mechanisms of thermal adaptation and the use of amino acid profiles to pre-dict growth temperature. For example, some studies propose the use of certain amino acid ratios (e.g. charged vs. polar amino acids) to predict optimal growth temperaturesof un-cultured organisms,69 but Methanopyrus kandleri seems to challenge our ability to make generalizations. Although it is unknown how Methanopyrus kandleri can live at high temperatures without altering its proteome amino acid com-position as other methanogens do, it is tempting to specu-late that the organism may have an altered cytosol content in comparison to other methanogens, but work is needed to clarify this. We note that protein compositional differences are associated with other environmental variables other than temperature; for example, pH, oxidation state7⁰ and salinity.71Future work is needed to build an integrative picture of how multiple variables affect the amino acid composition of the proteome.

## Gene gain and loss in methanogens

We used a species tree of the 86 species to investigate a possible phylogenetic relationship between gene gain-loss-duplication with temperature. Although the thermotolerant organisms have smaller genomes, correlations between temperature and gain-loss-duplication were not observed (Supplementary Fig. S7). This observation leaves open questions as to how the temperature:genome size relationship (Fig. 4A) came to be.

Thomas et al.72 showed that in comparison with 21 other Methanosarcinales, the genome of the rumendwelling and mesophilic methanogen Methanosarcina blatticola shows the largest genome reduction, with the loss of almost all genes

involved in the H,MPT (tetrahydromethanopterin) methyl branch of the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway. In line with this, our analysis shows that Methanosarcina blatticola has the highest reduction with a net gain rate of -0.36, while other Methanosarcinales show both net gains and losses. This clade-specific variance within the Methanosarcinales suggests that gene gain-loss-duplication rates are not solely governed by the phylogenetic placement of organisms, and it may be that this type of variability is part of what clouds our ability to observe a temperature gain-loss-duplication rate relationship.

## Conclusions

We observed differences in genome size and functional com-position across the genomes of methanogens spanning a wide growth temperature range. We show that differences in amino acid composition can be found at the whole genome level as well as in the functionally constant extended core. Thermotolerant methanogens have smaller, reduced gen-omes with an increase in charged amino acids and functional genes related to ion transport which are not found in their psychrotolerant counterparts. The latter have larger genomes with an increase in polar uncharged amino acids and add-itional functional genes related to cell structure and mobility. The organisms in our core genome analysis span three phyla but share a large extended core, suggesting that physiological similarity has a stronger effect on temperature adaptation than phylogenetic distance in the methanogens. We show that core size decreases with the increased phylogenetic distance between the methanogenic archaea,and it will be interesting to explore this trend across the tree of life.

The expansion of our knowledge of alkane-utilizing ar-chaea, their phylogenies, metabolisms and genomic features has widened our understanding of archaeal evolutionary his-tory in the past decade.7,69,73-80 Further studies focusing on their genome evolution can help us further narrow down the first appearances of methanogens and methanotrophs in Earth's history. The type of study conducted here could be expanded across a greater diversity of organisms, further helping to clarify how environmet, physiology and evolu-tion each contribute to genomic content.
